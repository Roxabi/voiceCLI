# Fail if any two pytest ``testpaths`` files resolve to the same bare module
# name under ``--import-mode=importlib``.
#
# Why: the root ``pyproject.toml`` sets ``--import-mode=importlib``. Under that
# mode pytest imports a test file via the parent chain of ``__init__.py``
# files — if an ``__init__.py`` is present, the module name is fully
# qualified (e.g. ``tests.nats.test_sanitize``); if it is absent, the module
# name is the file's bare basename (e.g. ``test_sanitize``).
#
# Two bare-basename files with the same name register under the same key in
# ``sys.modules``; the second import silently reuses the first and its
# assertions never run.
#
# Root ``tests/`` has a complete ``__init__.py`` chain, so its files are
# always fully qualified — same-basename files inside it are safe. The
# non-root testpaths (``packages/*/tests``) deliberately have no
# ``__init__.py`` (see ``packages/roxabi-contracts/tests/conftest.py``
# docstring for rationale), so they feed into the bare-basename pool. This
# guard checks that pool for duplicates.
