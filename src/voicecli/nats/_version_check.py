"""Schema-version envelope check (for the optional `schema_version` field).

WARNING: This module exists for the optional `schema_version` envelope
field used by some lyra subjects. ADR-044's `contract_version` field on
voice request/reply payloads is a SEPARATE concept and is read
defensively (no validation, log WARN on mismatch). Do NOT route
`contract_version` through this function.

A receiver accepts any payload whose ``schema_version`` is less than or equal
to the receiver's own compiled-in ``SCHEMA_VERSION_*`` constant (forward-compat
rule).  Strictly-greater versions are dropped with an ERROR log line and an
optional in-process counter increment — instead of silently misinterpreting
unknown or removed fields.

Missing field: treated as version 1 (legacy backwards-compat).
Non-int / null / negative / zero: treated as malformed → drop.

Log rate limiting
-----------------
To avoid a log-flood DoS when a botched deploy produces thousands of mismatches
per second, drop logs are rate-limited per envelope name to one ERROR line every
``_LOG_INTERVAL_S`` seconds (default 60).  The counter still increments on every
drop — rate limiting only affects log volume, not telemetry.  The limiter is
module-level state intentionally (log volume is a process-wide concern, unlike
the counter which needs per-instance isolation for correctness).

    - Missing field → treated as version 1 (legacy backwards compat).

    Parameters
    ----------
    payload:
        The decoded JSON dict received from NATS.
    envelope_name:
        Human-readable name of the envelope type (e.g. ``"InboundMessage"``).
        Used as the counter key, rate-limit key, and in the log line.
    expected:
        The ``SCHEMA_VERSION_*`` constant this receiver was compiled against.
    subject:
        The NATS subject the message arrived on — included in the log line for
        easier triage.  ``None`` renders as ``"<unknown>"``.
    counter:
        Caller-owned mutable dict; incremented at ``counter[envelope_name]`` on
        every drop.  Pass ``None`` to skip counting.
